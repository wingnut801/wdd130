        <p>Utah is a western U.S. state known for its diverse landscapes, including red rock formations, vast deserts, 
        and the snow-capped Rocky Mountains. It is home to five national parks and has a rich cultural heritage, with 
        strong ties to Native American history and early Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormon) pioneers. 
        Utah's capital, Salt Lake City, is a hub for outdoor recreation, arts, and industry.</p>
